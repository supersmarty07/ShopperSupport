## Background
I have been working at a Supermarket in the online department. I always felt the urge to change the way we receive orders on our device. When a customer orders an item, they can see the picture of what they are ordering. We, pickers of those orders, cannot see the picture of the item that a customer has ordered. This makes it difficult for us to pick the correct item. A lot of times, the pickers substitute the items with something else.
Why not create an app that lets you see the picture of the item by simply putting the article id? As  I am learning React, I thought it would be great for my learning if I can achieve something like this in React.

## Online Shopper Support
With this app, you simply input the article id that's shown on your order. The website is super-quick and lightweight. It instantly shows the picture along with description, price, stock on hand, and so much more information about the product. All you need is the article id that is provided on the order.

## Dummy Data
Since my supermarket does not allow public API, I had to use duummy data API. There are different APIs used for different Components. For example, image is retrieved from RoboHash API, description is retrieved from another API and so on . I used multiple APIs istead of 1 because I want my application to continue running even if 1 API fails. If my supermarket allows me to access their API, this web app can be used as a commercial app that can help 100s of Supermarket workers across the country.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
